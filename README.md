## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **full-stack developer** passionate about building **AI-powered, scalable web applications** with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and user experience. I enjoy designing systems that combine clean, modern UI with efficient backend architecture—especially in **education, productivity, and AI-driven platforms**.

I’m currently working on **production-grade AI systems**, exploring **model orchestration, caching strategies, Redis-based optimizations, and scalable cloud deployments**, and continuously refining real-world products used by active users.
